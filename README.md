# formfiller
App partition code for an accessible form-filler application with a multimodal interface. The completed application will present XForm question elements in a large text/large button format. It will also take voice input and output. This is my first test-driven development project and my first attempt at clean architecture. Currently building from the entity objects outward. Some transaction objects are partially implemented.

Not sure yet how to clean binaries out of a non-Android Eclipse project before commit.

Test Status:  All existing unit tests pass.
