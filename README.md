# formfiller
App partition code for an accessible form-filler application with a multimodal interface. The completed application will present XForm question elements in a large text/large button format. It will also take voice input and output. This is my first test-driven development project and my first attempt at clean architecture. Currently building from the entity objects outward. Some transaction objects are partially implemented.
